    <h3 style="margin-top:-15px;">What is going on here?</h3>
              <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
                <p>In short, we partner with high quality brands, then develop campaigns for projects they want to test -- you then 'back' the items you're interested in.
                    <br><br>
                  Once a campaign reaches its goal, the item is successfully funded and the brand starts production on the project. 
                    <br><br>
                    We (or the brand) ship off products when they are ready to go.</p>
              <hr>
    <h5>How can I support these projects?</h5>
              <ol>
                <li><h3>Back it:</h3> <p>A commitment to financially back the production of this item when enough people have shown interest (this will be clear on the page). Your card only gets charged after a product hits the goal of a number of backers.</p></li>
                <li><h3>Share it:</h3> <p>Broadcast out to people who you think would appreciate this brand or product. Products only get made with enough support, so spread the good word!</p></li>
                <li><h3>Preorder:</h3><p>After a product reaches its funding goal, you are still able to preorder it for the remainder of its time on the site. Keep in mind that you may get your goods after the first batch of orders are run -- case in point, back early to get your items quickly. </p><!-- <hr style="margin-bottom:5px;">No free shipping - early bird gets the worm!<hr style="margin-top:5px;"> --></li>
              </ol>
              <br>

    <h5>When does my card get charged?</h5>
                  <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
                  <p>When you hit “Back It”, we will collect your shipping and billing information - but will only authorize the charge, not actually charge you. When a campaign reaches its funding goal, your card will be securely charged. <br>**If an item expires without being funded, you will not be charged and your (payment & shipping) information will be cleared from our system.</p>
              <br>

    <h5>Is my billing information safe?</h5>
                  <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
                  <p>Of course. All payments are processed using 256-bit SSL encryption and our ecommerce platform is built on the premier payments platform, <a href="https://www.stripe.com/" target="blank">Stripe</a>. Stripe is certified to <a href="http://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do?companyNameCriteria=stripe" target="blank">PCI Service Provider Level 1</a>. This is the most stringent level of certification available.</p>
              <br>
    <h5 class="subh-font">Can I change my order or cancel it?</h5>
                  <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
                  <p>If a campaign hasn't been funded & shipped yet - you can change item options, shipping address, or cancel your order by following the "Click here to manage your order." link in your order email. If a product has been funded or shipped, you will need to <a href="mailto:support@farallon.co">get in touch</a> with us directly.</p>
                <br>
    <h5>When will my items be shipped?</h5>
                <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
              <p>The expected shipping date is listed on each item’s product page. We strive to beat that date, but hiccups may occur -- rest assured, if we (or our partner brands) get the hiccups, you'll be notified.</p>
                <br>
    <h5>Can an item be funded more than 100%?</h4>
                  <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
              <p>Yes, this is what we call a 'preorder'.</p>
              <br>

    <h5>Can I exchange or return an item after I receive it?</h5>
              <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
              <p>Due to the nature of this type of funding model, we will only accept returns if the product is deemed defective. We will make it right regardless.</p>

              <br>
    <h5>Who are the brands you feature? Why should I trust them?</h5>
              <hr style="margin-top:-5px;">
              <p>We built relationships with top-notch brands from all over the globe and will never feature a campaign that we wouldn't back ourselves. Most of the brands we will feature build their product in the U.S.A., but will feature any brand that is built with integrity - regardless of its origin.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Unlike traditional crowdfunding models, we only feature an established brand's products - which inherently takes alot of the risk out of backing a campaign. This is because established brands know their production capabilities and understand how to run a successful operation that delivers on their promises.</p>
              <br>

          <h6>Projects:</h6>
           <p>These are brand new concepts or collaborations that brands want to test to the masses. If they reach their 'tipping-point' of support, they get produced.
            <br><br>
            Customers are only charged when a product reaches its tipping point.
          </p>
            <hr>
          <h6>Brands:</h6>
          <p>This is a family of the best brands - with great stories to match. Some will be actively promoting 'Projects' & some are there for your discovery. <br><br>Either way, we encourage you to submit project ideas for your favorites & learn about them.</p>
